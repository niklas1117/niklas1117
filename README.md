Hi! Im Niklas, a recent finance graduate that is interested in financial mathematics.

I want to use this Git to share personal projects that i use to help with my financial markets exposure. 
You can expect things like trading support/risk management tools or stock screeners. 

The code is not perfect, but it does what i need it too <3
