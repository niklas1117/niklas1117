Hi! Im Niklas, a quantitative research analyst that is interested in systematic trading and investing.

So far I have mainly uploaded small projects with ugly code. 
As my programming experience level increases the quality of this code will too.

I am planning on working on a event driven backtester and an implementation for live trading.
